The primary objective of a BMI calculator coded in Python is to determine a person's Body Mass Index (BMI) and classify their weight status based on this calculated value.
A Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator in Python typically uses the following tools and concepts:
Basic Python Syntax: The core of the calculator relies on fundamental Python elements like:
Variables: To store weight, height, and the calculated BMI.
Input/Output Functions: input() to get user data (weight and height), and print() to display the BMI and its interpretation.
Data Types: Converting user input to appropriate numerical types, usually float for handling decimal values in height and weight.
Arithmetic Operators: For performing the BMI calculation (division and exponentiation for squaring height).
Conditional Statements (if/elif/else): To interpret the calculated BMI and categorize it (underweight, normal, overweight, obese).
     BMI = weight_kg / (height_m ** 2) 
         BMI = (weight_lbs / (height_in ** 2)) * 703
         Building a BMI calculator in Python involves several distinct steps:
Obtain User Input:
Prompt the user to enter their weight. This input should be in kilograms (kg).
Prompt the user to enter their height. This input should be in meters (m).
Convert these inputs to floating-point numbers using float() to handle potential decimal values.
Calculate BMI:
Apply the BMI formula: BMI = weight / (height * height) or BMI = weight / (height ** 2).
The calculated BMI is then compared against predefined ranges to determine a health category. Common categories and their associated BMI ranges include:
Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
Normal Weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9
Obesity: BMI of 30 or greater
The program prints the calculated BMI value and the corresponding health category to the console.
